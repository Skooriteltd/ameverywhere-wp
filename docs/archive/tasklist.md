## 🚦 WordPress.org Production-Readiness Release Tracker

> **Authoritative backlog:** `production-readiness-backlog.md`
> **Release status:** **Not ready for WordPress.org submission.** “Implemented” means source changes exist and local lint/unit/build validation passed; it does **not** mean the acceptance criteria are complete. No item below may be changed to complete until its stated integration, browser, package, and policy evidence is attached.

| ID | Status | Current state / next release gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR-001 | In progress | Activation fatal removed and lifecycle code updated. Verify activation, reactivation, deactivation, uninstall, and upgrades in real single-site and multisite WordPress. |

| PR-010 | In progress | Cookie asset path fixed and the notice no longer claims CMP/legal compliance. Complete browser, accessibility, and legal-copy review. |
| PR-011 | In progress | Deprecated Google sitemap pings removed; plugin sitemap is opt-in and core sitemap coexistence is preserved. Verify with core and major SEO plugins. |
| PR-012 | In progress | Redirect, link-check, schema-validator, and competitor-fetch hardening added. Complete outbound-request inventory and SSRF/redirect tests. |

## ⚠️ Architectural Guardrails & Core Technical Exclusions

Based on production-grade WordPress scaling patterns, the following tasks require strict guardrails or deferred off-server handling to protect client server resources:

### 1. Broken Link & Image Scanner `[TT-003]` (Deferred / SaaS Gated)
* **Risk Context**: Performing standard, recursive crawling loops natively on your WordPress origin server causes immediate CPU locks, runs into PHP script execution timeouts, and bloats `wp_options`. Furthermore, major hosting companies (WPEngine, Kinsta) ban internal link crawling plugins.
* **Mitigation**: 
  1. *Primary Strategy*: Offload crawling completely to a decoupled SaaS API service. The plugin registers a webhook to receive reports, rather than running recursive curl checks natively.
  2. *Fallback Strategy*: If local execution is forced, scans must be throttled to a maximum of 5 URL check pings per minute via low-priority `wp_schedule_single_event` triggers.

### 2. Autonomous Agent Linking Loops `[AUTO-001]` & Predictions `[AUTO-002]` (Decoupled execution)
* **Risk Context**: Running machine-learning pipelines or recursive multi-prompt GPT cycles in PHP freezes browser tabs, locks standard DB connections, and generates immediate browser 504 Gateway Timeouts.
* **Mitigation**: Decouple reasoning from PHP. The plugin strictly publishes data endpoints (like the structured `/schemamap` feed) and consumes pre-compiled agent decisions computed in safe cloud worker queues.

### 3. Editor Real-Time Assistant `[ACO-001]` (Debouncing / On-Demand UI)
* **Risk Context**: Dispatching API calls to LLM endpoints on every keystroke causes extreme billing costs for the user and floods the server connection gateway.
* **Mitigation**:
  1. Debounce Gutenberg client state changes by at least 3,000ms after a user halts typing before calling the assistant API.
  2. Maintain a prominent manual "Click to Analyze" button inside the React editor sidebar to ensure requests are primarily user-initiated.

### 4. Live Frontend Overlay SEO Inspector `[TT-008]` (Security Scope)
* **Risk Context**: Injecting script markers or diagnostic debuggers onto public-facing page loads exposes sensitive path details and can easily break third-party CDN / plugin static cache engines.
* **Mitigation**:
  1. Encapsulate the entire live overlay DOM cleanly within a sandboxed shadow root (`ShadowDOM`).
  2. Wrap initialization checks strictly within `current_user_can('edit_posts')` capability boundaries, preventing any visitor script load.
