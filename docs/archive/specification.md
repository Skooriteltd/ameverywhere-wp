3. **Crawler Intelligence**: User-agent detection to serve optimized content variants for AI bots vs. traditional crawlers
4. **Attribution Tracking**: Embed lightweight, privacy-safe markers to help trace AI citations back to source content
5. **User-Key Security**: API keys encrypted at rest, never transmitted to AmEveryWhere servers, with local validation where possible
6. **Model Abstraction**: Unified prompt/response interface allowing seamless switching between providers without code changes
